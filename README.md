# FileInterleaver
A Simple Binary Interleaver in C#

I used this to compile 8 Different Mono PCM audio files into one 7.1 PCM file.
Worked great, But unfortunately my headphone only have Virtual 7.1 Surround. so, I cannot really tell it great or not unless I borrow my friend's 7.1 speaker set.

Uses .NET Framework 3.5 and Winforms.

Use and improve it as you want. It's simple and the compilation is straightforward.
